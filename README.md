# This repo contains some CSS3 examples.
# This is just a kind of hello world toolkit for me to test

## Animations
* Example 1: In the middle of the screen place a circle. It has to be on the very center. (learn about position absolute and border radius)
* Example 2: Place a blue square on the page and add a button, when you click on the button the blue square should change color to red and should grow 200%
* Example 3:Get an image of a wheel and make it spin forever. The velocity should be controlled by slider (html native slider) (learn about css3 keyframes)
* Example 4: Make a square that morphs into a ball forever and make an animation that moves the object from one side to the other.
* Example 5: Make a hover menu using only ul, li and css. Hardcode a menu using nested ul and li and display them on mouse over.
